<h1 align="middle">Assignment 3 Part 2: PathTracer</h1>

    <div class="padded">
        <p>In this part of the project, we chose to implement parts 1 and 4, which included rendering for mirror and glass as well as different apertures and focal lengths. </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h2>

    	<h3>Task 1 + 2: Reflection and Mirror Material</h3>
    	<p>For the reflection portion of this part, we implemented the reflect and sample_f methods. Because wo is defined as a vector pointing towards the direction of an outgoing (post-reflection) ray of light, and wi is definedf
			as a vector in the direction opposite the ray of incoming light (i.e. the vector points towards the direction that the incoming light ray is coming FROM), geometrically our wi vector ends up being equivalent
		to the wo vector reflected about the z axis. This means that both x and y are flipped, so wi = (-wo.x, -wo.y, wo.z). After implementing this in our reflection method, the sampling method is straightforward:
	because we only need to sample in the direction of the reflection, i.e. wi, we have our pdf as 1, set our wi using our reflect method, and return reflectance / abs_cos_theta(*wi) as in the spec. This returned value is becaudse
for mirrors, we don't have any Lambertian falloff, and we need to divide by cosine theta to cancel it out so our final value is just the reflectance.</p>
    	<h3>Task 3: Refraction</h3>
    	<p>For refraction, we first see whether our index of refraction refers to a material our ray of light is exiting or if it corresponds to a material our ray is exiting. For our purposes here, we are assuming that light rays do not pass directly from one 
			non-air material into another. Because our z axis is the normal of our surface, we know that if our z value in wo is positive, the ray that we are tracing is entering the material, and if it is negative then our ray is exiting the material. Using this, we can simply
			check the sign of our wo.z, and set our eta to 1/ior if it's positive and ior if it's negative. Then, by doing some basic trigonometry to find our ray's x, y, and z coordinates in terms of spherical coordinates theta and phi (or by looking at the spec), then using
			Snell's law to see that sin(theta_prime) = eta * sin(theta) and acknowledging that our phi_prime is simply pi degrees opposite our phi, we can find (or read from the spec) that the x and y components of our wi vector are simply our x and y components of our wo vector scaled by eta and negated, whereas 
			our z component for wi is sqrt(1 - eta^2 * (1 - wo.z^2)) (the sign of which is opposite the sign of wo.z). We also check to make sure the inside of our square root is positive, as if it is negative then this represents total internal reflection and no light is refracted. </p>
		<p>Now that we have our direction vector for wi, in our sampling function for refraction we set wi appropriately with our refract method, set pdf to 1 once again for similar reasons as in the mirrors, and return transmittance / abs_cos_theta(*wi) / eta^2 (where we divide by eta^2 to account for the concentration and dispersion of light
			that happens when we enter and exit a material with a higher ior). 
		</p>
    	<h3>Task 4: Glass</h3>
		<p>Now that we have reflection and refraction in place, we can emulate glass, which does both, in our GlassBSDF::sample_f function. First, we check for total internal reflection by seeing if our refract function returns false, signifying that our wo vector corresponds to total internal reflection. If so, then we 
			exhibit purely reflective behavior, the same as in our mirror sample_f function. If this is not the case, then we calculate our Schlick's reflection coefficient, which is defined as R = R0 + (1-R0) * (1 - cos(theta)^5). Here, because we are only dealing with entering and exiting from/to air, our R0 is simply ((ior-1)/(ior+1))^2, and 
			we are assisted by the fact that cos(theta) is just the magnitude of wo.z. Now that we have R, we simply do a coin flip on this coefficient: with probability R, we exhibit reflective (as in sample_f for the mirror), and with probability 1-R, we exhibit refractive behavior (as in our refract sample_f). The only difference here is that we scale our reflective and refractive
			vectors by R an 1-R respectively.

		<p>In the 0 bounce radiance, we can see only the light source.</p>
		<p> With 1 bounce, we can also see the walls and reflection of the light on the spheres, but most of the spheres are black because our ray tracing only hits the light source on one bounce
			with the direct highlights of the spheres, due to their reflective nature. We can see that the highlight of the glass sphere is less defined, as some of these rays are coin flipping to refraction and being lost to the single bounce.
		</p>
		<p> With 2 bounce, the mirror sphere now shows the walls in addition to the light source. We can also see the reflective portion of the glass.</p>
		<p> With 3 bounce, the refraction of the glass is now also visible.</p>
		<p> With 4 bounce, we can now see the light that goes through the glass, bounces off the mirror, and into the viewer. We can also see more reflection on the bottom of the glass ball. The image is now mostly 
			"complete"; with 5 bounce to 100 bounce, the lighting becomes more accurate and softer, with a similar effect as non mirror/glass objects.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Depth of Field: </h2>
    	<h3>Implementation Summary</h3>

        <p>The goal of this function was to be able to return the ray from originating at pLens and heading towards pFocus in the world frame. The implementation of this function was pretty closely aligned with the description provided in the project spec. The first step was to look at the generated ray direction of the ray from proj 3-1, which was the ray from the origin of the camera's frame (where the camera is located) to the point corresponding point in the z=-1 plane of the camera's frame where the point (x, y) in image coordinates should map to. Then, by considering the direction of the ray as a velocity, we can see that in 1 timestep, it will travel 1 unit in the negative z direction (from z = 0 to z=-1), thus by scaling this vector by the focalDistance, we can identify the change in the x and y coordinates in the time it took to travel focalDistance units in the negative z direction (from z = 0 to z = -focalDistance). This 3D point in the camera's frame where z = -focalDistance is the point of intersection of the original ray through the camera's origin and the plane of focus, also referred to as pFocus.</p>

        <p>Once pFocus was found, the next step was to find pLens. Taking the random sampling parameters (rndR and rndTheta) passed in via arguments in the function call, we generate pLens following the formula provided in the spec. After identifying both pLens and pFocus, we found the direction of the ray from pLens to pFocus by subtracting pLens from pFocus and then normalizing it. Now we have the origin and direction of the ray from pLens to pFocus in the camera frame, in order to get these two components in the world frame, we first multiply both 3-dimensional vectors by the c2w matrix. Then, because pLens is a point we also add the translation between the world and camera frames which is just the location of the camera, or pos. Now given the origin and direction of the ray from pLens to pFocus in the world frame, we construct the ray, set its near and far clips, and returned the ray.</p>

        <p>Looking at this "focus stack" taken with a lensRadius of 0.2 and different focalDistances, we can see that as we vary the focalDistance, different parts of the dragon come into view. As the focalDistance went from 3.0 to 5.2, we could see that various parts of the dragon statue, starting from the mouth and heading towards the tail, came into focus.</p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h3>Differences Between Pinhole Camera Model and Thin-lens Camera Model</h3>

        <p>The differences between the pinhole camera model and thin-lens camera model arise when we start considering the camera as a disk-shaped lens because our point in the image coordinates is no longer only considering radiance received from a ray that passes through a single point (origin of camera frame). Instead, it considers radiance received from various points of the disk-shaped lens. By specifying the parameters of the camera lens (lensRadius and focalDistance), the thin-lens camera model can start to render some portions of a scene clearly (in focus) and some points of the scene quite blurrily (out of focus), where the pinhole camera model will render the entire scene in focus. Given the way the focalDistance works, all points on the camera lens will intersect and pass through the same point on the plane of focus, however, in order for the rays from different places on the lens to converge, the points in the scene from which different places on the lens received radiance will be futher apart the further that the object is from plane of focus. This creates blurriness or "out of focus" as radiance from points far away in the scene are shown in the same location of the image. This effect is further exagerrated as the lensRadius grows since now the sample points on the lens can be further and further apart.</p>
